The stamen is the male organ of reproduction and the pistil the female.
The actual process of fertilization, pregnancy, the forming of the fruit
and later the seed, and the latter’s birth of a new plant, comprise one
of the most fascinating of those provisions of nature which secure the
perpetuation of the plant world. In the life history of even the
commonest weed along the roadside there is this constant renewal of life
by sexual reproduction, just as in animals and in man. In the chapter on
“How Plants Produce Their Young” will be found some account of this
supreme function of flowers, after which, as if their usefulness were
over, they wither and perish.
